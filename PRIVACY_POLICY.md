# SaveWord: Privacy Policy

This is an open source Android application that is developed by Gürbüz Uğurgül. The project source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the application is also available on Google Play.

This application is not programmed to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (for example, the words that you saved) is stored on your device only. You can delete this data and you can uninstall the application easily.

If you have found a security vulnerability in the application that was not noticed by me, you can report it to me via my e-mail address. I can try to solve the issue quickly.

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
